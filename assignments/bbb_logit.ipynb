    "Analyzing the summary of the Logistic Regression results, we can see that all coefficients are significant because all of their p-values are less than 0.05 However, their impacts on the probability of being a buyer all vary, some being very helpful while others not being very helpful. To analysze which ones are more impactful, we look at the coefficient's odds ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The way odds-ratio works is for every unit of increase in a certain coefficient's category, we multiply the probability of being a buyer by that coefficient's odds ratio. Looking at the odds ratio of our Logistic Regression, we can see that a handful of coefficients have an odds ratio of less than 1. Specifically, ```last```, ```female```, ```child```, ```youth```, ```cook```, and ```do_it``` all have odds ratios less than 1. What this means is that for every unit of increase in any of those categories separately, $P(buyer)$ actually ends up decreasing. For example, for an increase of 1 ```youth``` book purchase by a customer, the probability of them buying from this catalog is multiplied by 0.893, which decreases the probability of them purchasing from our catalog according to the Logistic Regression Model. Since each of these categories have a odds ratio of less than 1, they will end up decreasing our $P(buyer)$ if the number in those categories increases. Therefore, while they are significant in our model, they are not important.\n",
    "\n",
    "```total_``` has an odds ratio of about 1, so a unit of increase in a customer's total spending increases the probability of them buying from thsi catalog by a factor of 1, which is not really that helpful. ```total_``` is a significant coefficient, but not really important since it doesn't really increase $P(buyer)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The important coefficients here are ```refernce```, ```art```, and ```geog```. They all have an odds ratio of greater than 1. This means that for every unit of increase in each of these categories, the probability of a customer purchasing from this catalog increases by a factor of 1.26, 3.17, and 1.77, respectively. Since these ratios are greater than one, the probability will increase for every additional unit purchased in eqach respective category. Therefore, these are the important variables that we should focus on."

    "Yes, the patterns in the decile analysis is consisten with my conclusions from the logistic regression, specifically when analyzing odds ratio. When analyzing odds ratio, I found out that the important variables to look at were ```refernce```, ```art```, and ```geog```, since they all had an odds ratio of greater than 1. Looking at the mean values based on probability of purchase deciles, we can see as the decile number increases, the mean values for these three categories decrease. On the other hand, the mean value for all the other categories stay relatively in the same range for each decile, which makes them not really a good predictor of the probability of a customer being a buyer. This was also given in our odds ratio analysis, since these variables (```last```, ```child```, ```youth```, ```cook```, and ```do_it```) were not important according to our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our logistic regression analysis, we saw that art had the highest odds ratio of 3.17, meaning it was the most impactful variable in predicting the probability of a customer being a buyer. This meant that as a customer purchased more art books in the past, the probability of them being a buyer increased by a factor of 3.17. Looking at the mean analysis per decile, we can see the top decile has the highest mean of art books purchased, being 1.5. As the deciles increase, the mean of art books purchased decreases. Those in decile 0 had the highest mean of art books purchased, which our odds ratio predicts that they have a higher probability of responding to our catalog. Looking at the decile response rate grah, we can see that decile 0 had the highest response rate to our catalog, which shows that our decile analysis is consistent with our logistic regression analysis."
